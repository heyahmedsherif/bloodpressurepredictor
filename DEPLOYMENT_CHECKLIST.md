# Railway Deployment Checklist

## âœ… **Deployment Files Created**

- [x] `Dockerfile` - Complete with system dependencies
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway configuration  
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies (Streamlit Cloud removed)
- [x] `.dockerignore` - Optimized build exclusions
- [x] `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment instructions

## âœ… **Code Changes**

- [x] Simplified recording interface (single button)
- [x] Live camera preview by default
- [x] Removed Twilio/WebRTC components
- [x] Removed Streamlit Cloud specific files
- [x] Fixed all set_page_config() conflicts
- [x] Updated imports (removed WebRTC dependencies)

## âœ… **Ready for Railway**

### Camera Support
- [x] Full OpenCV support (`opencv-python` instead of headless)
- [x] System dependencies in Dockerfile
- [x] Camera access through browser

### App Features  
- [x] Single recording button with live preview
- [x] Real-time PPG extraction
- [x] Health predictions (BP, glucose, cholesterol, HR)
- [x] Clean, simplified UI

### Production Optimizations
- [x] Streamlit configured for Railway (port 8080)
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Optimized Docker layers
- [x] Minimal build context

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Railway deployment ready"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Go to railway.app
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Test deployment**
   - Wait for build (~3-5 minutes)
   - Access provided URL
   - Test camera functionality

## ðŸ”§ **Local Testing**

Test before deployment:
```bash
conda activate bloodpressure
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Expected behavior:
- âœ… Single recording button
- âœ… Live camera preview
- âœ… PPG processing works
- âœ… Health predictions display

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Railway Performance**

- **Build time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Cold start**: ~30 seconds  
- **Warm requests**: <2 seconds
- **Camera latency**: Minimal (browser-based)

App is ready for production deployment! ðŸŽ‰
