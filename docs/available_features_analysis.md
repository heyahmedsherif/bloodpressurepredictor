# Available Features Analysis for Blood Pressure Prediction

## Investigation Results: What's Actually Available

### üîç **Current Status of PaPaGei Datasets:**

**Reality Check:**
- **MESA Dataset**: Not available locally (referenced in code but data missing)
- **VitalDB Dataset**: Not available locally (referenced in code but data missing)  
- **MIMIC Dataset**: Not available locally (referenced in code but data missing)

**What PaPaGei Actually Has:**
- PPG signal processing and feature extraction capabilities
- Model architectures for processing physiological signals
- No demographic or clinical metadata in the current codebase

### üìä **What Real Cardiovascular Datasets Typically Contain:**

Based on research of major cardiovascular datasets used in literature:

#### **Basic Demographics (Usually Available):**
‚úÖ **Age** - Almost always available
‚úÖ **Gender/Sex** - Standard demographic
‚úÖ **Height** - Common measurement
‚úÖ **Weight** - Common measurement  
‚úÖ **BMI** - Often calculated or provided

#### **Clinical Measurements (Often Available):**
‚úÖ **Blood Pressure** - Target variable, usually available
‚úÖ **Heart Rate** - Basic vital sign
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cholesterol** - Available in clinical studies but not wearable data
‚ö†Ô∏è **Glucose** - Available in clinical studies but not routine PPG datasets

#### **Lifestyle Factors (Rarely Available in PPG Datasets):**
‚ùå **Smoking Status** - Usually not in PPG datasets
‚ùå **Alcohol Consumption** - Rarely quantified
‚ùå **Exercise Hours** - Not typically tracked in medical datasets
‚ùå **Sleep Hours** - Only in specialized sleep studies
‚ùå **Stress Level** - Subjective, rarely quantified
‚ùå **Sodium/Potassium Intake** - Requires dietary surveys

#### **Medical History (Sometimes Available):**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Family History** - Available in clinical studies, not wearable data
‚ö†Ô∏è **Diabetes** - Sometimes coded in clinical datasets
‚ö†Ô∏è **Kidney Disease** - Medical history, not always recorded

#### **Physical Measurements (Rarely Available):**
‚ùå **Waist Circumference** - Clinical studies only
‚ùå **Neck Circumference** - Specialized sleep studies only

### üéØ **Realistic Feature Set for PPG-Based BP Prediction:**

#### **Tier 1: Almost Always Available**
- **Age** (years)
- **Gender** (M/F) 
- **Height** (cm)
- **Weight** (kg)
- **BMI** (calculated)
- **PPG Signal Features** (from PaPaGei embeddings)

#### **Tier 2: Sometimes Available**  
- **Resting Heart Rate** (from PPG or manual measurement)
- **Medical Conditions** (diabetes, hypertension history)

#### **Tier 3: Rarely Available in PPG Datasets**
- **Cholesterol levels**
- **Lifestyle factors** (smoking, exercise, sleep)
- **Dietary factors**
- **Physical measurements** beyond height/weight

### üìà **Evidence from Literature:**

**Key Studies on PPG-Based BP Prediction:**

1. **Kachuee et al. (2017)** - Used age, gender, height, weight + PPG features
2. **Panwar et al. (2020)** - Demographics + PPG morphological features
3. **Schrumpf et al. (2021)** - Age, BMI, gender + deep PPG features
4. **Monte-Moreno et al. (2011)** - Basic demographics + PPG pulse wave analysis

**Common Pattern:** Most successful PPG-BP prediction systems use:
- **Basic demographics** (age, gender, BMI)
- **PPG-derived features** (heart rate, pulse wave morphology)
- **Minimal clinical data** (when available)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Recommendations for Realistic BP Predictor:**

#### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Features**
Use only features that are realistically available:
```python
realistic_features = [
    'age',                    # Almost always available
    'gender_male',           # Standard demographic  
    'height_cm',             # Basic measurement
    'weight_kg',             # Basic measurement
    'bmi',                   # Calculated from height/weight
    'ppg_heart_rate',        # Derived from PPG signal
    'ppg_embedding_features' # PaPaGei 512-dim embeddings
]
```

#### **Phase 2: Extended Features** (if available)
```python
extended_features = [
    # Tier 1 features +
    'systolic_bp_history',   # Previous BP measurements
    'diabetes',              # Medical history flag
    'hypertension_family',   # Family history flag
]
```

### üéØ **Practical Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Start Simple**: Build BP predictor with only age, gender, BMI + PPG embeddings
2. **Validate Performance**: Test accuracy with minimal features
3. **Add Complexity Gradually**: Include additional features as they become available
4. **Real-World Focus**: Design for features actually available in clinical/wearable settings

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**

The current BP predictor app includes many features that are **not typically available** in real PPG datasets. A **realistic version** should focus on:

- **Basic demographics** (age, gender, BMI) 
- **PPG-derived features** (heart rate, PaPaGei embeddings)
- **Minimal clinical data** (previous BP readings if available)

This approach would be much more **clinically viable** and **practically deployable** in real-world settings.
